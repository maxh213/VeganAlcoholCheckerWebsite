# VeganAlcoholCheckerWebsite
Making a website for the twitter (https://twitter.com/veganAlcoholChe) and facebook(https://www.facebook.com/veganAlcoholChecker/) chatbots. The main reason for this is so the chatbot can send a URL for more information if they enter a really common name. For example if someone asks them if corona is vegan the bots will ask them to be more specific because over 20 drinks match the name corona. Once this site will be completed it will just allow the bots to link them to a movile friendly summary instead.
